# Building Reinforcement Learning Trading Model

## Introduction

This project builds a reinforcement learning trading model that simullates a trading environment. The model uses a deep Q-learning algorithm to learn the optimal trading strategy. The model is trained on historical stock price data and learns to maximize the cumulative returns by taking long and short positions in the stock.

## Project Steps

1. **Setup and Data Preparation:**
     Set up the development environment and prepare historical market data for training the agent.
2. **Environment Design:** Create a simulated trading environment where the agent can learn and test its strategies.
3. **Agent Implementation:** Encode the DQN model, defining the neural network architecture and training loop.
4. **Training the Agent:** Train the agent using historical data. 
5. **Evaluation and Testing:** Evaluate the agent's performance through a single validation test.
